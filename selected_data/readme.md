This folder stores images that have been filtered out by the two filters. 

If the `move` option of ES filter is True, a folder named `es_selected_images` will be created to save the filtered images. 
Similarly, if the `move` option of PSAS filter is True, a folder named `psas_selected_images` will be created to save the filtered images. 

By default, the option for the ES filter is set to False, while the PSAS filter is set to True. This is because we will use the images in the `psas_selected_images` folder to run simulated attacks.
