This folder is used to save image data:

- `attackers`: Stores the cropped images of attackers used to test in the filters.

- `laser_images`: Contains the simulated laser images.
- `synthetic_attackers`: Stores the simulated attacker images with laser.
- `theMany`: Contains faces that need to be filtered. For untargeted impersonation, these are the targets; for targeted impersonation, these are the original attackers.
- `theOne`: For untargeted impersonation, this folder contains the attacker images; for targeted impersonation, it contains the target images.
- `real_images` folder is used for testing real-world attacks. To test, you can record a video, convert it to frames, and then place the frames in this folder for testing.
